            Self Esteem aka Rebecca Lucy Taylor released her new album Prioritise Pleasure a couple of weeks ago, which
            coincided with two of my lovely friends visiting me. At every opportunity that weekend, whether we were
            drinking wine and getting ready to go out or making breakfast in the morning - we had the new album on
            repeat. We listened to an interview with her on the radio as we made margaritas and talked about her pretty
            much non-stop. It got me wondering why Self Esteem has had such a huge impact on me and those around me. <br><br>

            Rotherham born Rebecca started out in the folksy, indie duo Slow Club before going solo with the bold and
            wonderful Self Esteem. Rebecca openly talks about the reasons she left Slow Club, namely that she was sick
            of being put in a box as the submissive, meek female. Rebecca has said that she was tired of shrinking
            herself and compromising who she really was, so learnt to say a big fuck it to everything she thought she
            was supposed to be doing and set out on a mission to shed her people pleasing tendencies. Rebecca talks
            about how going solo with Self Esteem has helped her to truly express herself and break free from seeking
            approval. On her social media, she often shares messages from men who tell her that they much preferred her
            in Slow Club, which I think says it all really. People don’t like to see confident, self-assured women <br><br>

            Self Esteem writes songs that we can all relate to. Listening to her music feels like a drunken conversation
            with your best mate. She reminds me of parts of myself and my friends and all the great people that I know.
            Her new album is of the same calibre as her first, and I have had it on repeat ever since it came out. Has
            there ever been a better opening line to a song than ‘sexting you at the mental health talk seems
            counterproductive’? I think not. One of the songs from her new album has a fantastic part that is completely
            made up of comments that men have said to her throughout her life, including a Slow Club tour manager saying
            to her ‘all you need to do darling is fit in that little dress of yours’. Disgusting, but not surprising.
            Another of her new songs has a sound clip from some work she did at the National Youth Theatre, where a
            group of young women are talking about how if they are approached by a group of men they will bark like dogs
            – ‘as there is nothing that terrifies a man more than a woman who appears completely deranged’ which I think
            is just great and very relatable. <br><br>


            The genre of Self Esteem has also been interesting to me. When I was about 18, I mostly listening to indie
            music made by men. I thought that liking pop music was a bit embarrassing and basic, and I realise now that
            this is because I had internalised this view that a fun media form dominated by women was subpar. It’s the
            same sort of vibe as when people mock women for getting a boomerang of their cocktails, as if being a woman
            and having fun with your friends is something to be ashamed of. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve realised that pop
            is really bloody great. There’s this totally wrong idea that pop music is superficial and one dimensional,
            and Self Esteem breaks all those stereotypes through showing us that pop can be exciting and experimental
            whilst also making some big important, comments on the patriarchy. Her songs are sometimes upbeat and fun
            and sometimes slow with poignant lyrics and big strings. Often singing about relationships, I appreciate the
            fact that whilst she ardently sings about toxic, awful exes, she also recognises the part that she has
            played in causing harm to those she loved, holding a mirror up to us all as an example of accountability. <br><br>

            My love for Self Esteem is wrapped up in so many memories. I Do This All The Time reminds me of being on a
            road trip with my friend, both of us singing it at the top of our lungs and having that goosebumpy, euphoric
            feeling. In Time reminds me of seeing her live in Brixton and the whole crowd shouting along to the line SO
            I’M GONNA GET DRUNK AND SLAG YOU OFF THEN I’M GONNA GO HOME AND EAT MY FEELINGS - a sense of us all having
            been there and knowing exactly how that feels. Steady I Stand reminds me of a strength I mustered during a
            particularly rocky time a couple of years back, where I would listen to that song on repeat and remind
            myself that I still somehow had my feet firmly on the ground. The Best reminds me of living with my amazing
            pal when I had just moved to London and we would play it in the kitchen whilst we cooked dinner. Although
            her new album has just come out, I feel a real sense of nostalgia and the songs remind me of past
            experiences and feelings I’ve had. I’ve got a long way to go to reach the levels of authenticity and
            self-acceptance that Self Esteem has, but I am sure that she is helping me along my way. <br><br>
