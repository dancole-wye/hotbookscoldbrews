            <p class="mb-0">"The Windrush Scandal wasn’t a mistake. It was the direct consequence of a harsh set of
                policies designed to bring down immigration numbers by ejecting people from Britain, and by making life
                intolerable without documents. Conservative ministers would like us to remember this scandal as an
                unfortunate bureaucratic error for which they have apologised for repeatedly. But this was a deliberate
                strategy” </p>

            In her book, Amelia Gentleman details her journey to expose the true extent of the Windrush scandal, which
            she began investigating back in 2017. In part due to Gentleman’s investigative journalism, the media
            coverage of the scandal gained widespread attention, to the point where it became impossible for the
            government to ignore the harm they had caused. Becoming increasingly obsessed with anti-immigration agendas
            and arbitrary targets, they had introduced harsh measures to tackle what was perceived as high numbers of
            illegal immigrants in the UK. As a result of introducing these policies without proper systems in place (or
            any thought given to how it would affect people’s lives), a huge number of people who were here legally were
            caught up in a system that ruined their lives, a damage so deep as to never really be undone. <br><br>



            For anyone who may not know the technicalities, the ‘Windrush generation’ refers to people who came to the
            UK from Caribbean countries between 1948 and 1973, when the law stipulated free movement between countries
            in the commonwealth. Many of these people were coming from countries that had not yet gained independence
            from the UK, and had it drilled into them growing up that they were British through and through. They sung
            the national anthem at school and were taught to worship the monarchy. Entering the UK legally when they
            were children, they could not have predicted that decades later, the life that they had built would be
            cruelly taken away from them. The name Windrush actually comes from the ship HMT Empire Windrush, which
            transported passengers from Caribbean countries to the UK in the late 1940’s. The Windrush generation has
            become more of an umbrella term and does not necessarily just refer to those who boarded the ship, but also
            the subsequent generation, who were the main group affected by this particular scandal. <br><br>



            Anti-immigration rhetoric has long been part of British society, but the assimilation and normalisation of
            right-wing views into mainstream politics meant that reducing net migration became the number one concern
            for voters. Under pressure from this mounting concern, both the Conservative and Labour parties pledged to
            crack down on immigration. In 2012, Theresa May laid out her plan to create a “hostile environment” for
            illegal immigrants, aimed at making people’s lives such a living hell that they are forced to leave. The
            result of this devastating policy was that British citizens, who came here legally 50-60 years ago and were
            working as nurses, teaching assistants and ambulance drivers with decades of tax paying behind them, were
            all of a sudden being told that they were in the UK illegally. Without the “correct documentation”, which
            was often an indefinite leave to remain stamp in their childhood passports from when they first arrived,
            their alternative evidence of having spent decades in the UK paying taxes was dismissed. Many were told that
            they could not be found anywhere on record, which turned out to be a result of the Home Office deliberately
            destroying documents during a clear out. People were evicted from their tenancies and made homeless, let go
            from their jobs, denied essential NHS treatment and denied access to benefits. Left unable to pay for
            administration or legal fees, their lives as they knew it were turned upside down. Living in a constant
            state of anxiety, some were ripped from their families and taken to detention centres, some were bullied
            into leaving, some were handcuffed onto a plane, some visited relatives in the Caribbean and were denied
            entry back to the UK, leaving them homeless and jobless in an unfamiliar country.   <br><br>



            The book makes the case that, not unsurprisingly, the hostile environment created an increase in racial
            discrimination and racist abuse in the UK. The new policies meant that landlords, doctors and employers had
            to try their best to become experts in immigration law overnight, as it was now their responsibility to
            check people’s immigration status, with hefty fines to pay if they got it wrong. You’re white and you have
            an English sounding name? No worries. But if something about you even remotely suggested that you might be
            an immigrant, say for example, the colour of your skin, employers were likely to be wary of hiring you.
            After all, why take the risk of getting a crippling fine to employ someone who might be an immigrant, rather
            than going for the safe option. As Dianne Abbott stated at the time “it’s almost impossible to produce a
            hostile environment for immigrants and not produce a hostile environment for people who look like
            immigrants”. Then there was the governments introduction of Operation Vaken, which saw vans driving around
            London boroughs with the slogan ‘Go Home or Face Arrest’. Designed to evoke fear and make people feel unsafe
            in their own neighbourhoods, it was hoped that people would be so afraid of being arrested that they would
            leave the country of their own accord. Gentleman tells us that 47% of the British public approved of this
            initiative, but to the Windrush generation the vans sent one message – you are not welcome here. Those
            affected have said that the vans echoed what they had heard when they first arrived in this country half a
            century ago, that they needed to go back to where they came from. In a later report about the government’s
            handling of the Windrush situation, the National Audit Office found that there was no evidence to suggest
            that the hostile environment policies would benefit the UK economy. So, if the policies weren’t going to
            save money, which is often the taxpayers primary concern in any immigration debate, what else was driving
            the policies other than blatant racism? <br><br>



            I can’t even begin to imagine the heartache, shame and pain people must have felt. To be made to feel like a
            criminal in your own country and to have everything you have worked hard for taken away in an instant. One
            of the personal accounts in the book is that of Sylvester Marshall, a mechanic in his 60s who came to the UK
            legally as a teenager. When he was referred for radiotherapy to treat stage 2 prostate cancer, mandatory NHS
            checks instructed by the government flagged him up as being in the UK illegally. He was told that unless he
            produced documents that proved he was ‘ordinarily resident and legally entitled to live in the UK’ he would
            have to pay £54,000 for his cancer treatment ‘in full, in advance’. Sylvester’s ex wife had thrown many of
            his belongings after their divorce, including his expired Jamaican passport that he came to the UK with,
            which held the all important evidence he needed – an indefinite leave to remain stamp. At the time of
            Gentleman’s interviews with him, Sylvester was living in a hostel for homeless people. Too unwell with
            cancer to work, he was put on a high priority list for a council flat, but when questions around his
            immigration status arose, the promise of stable housing was revoked. He visited immigration headquarters to
            find a record of the paperwork that was completed when he first arrived in the UK, but they said there was
            no trace of him on their system. Sylvester was then kicked out of the homeless hostel, which was not
            permitted to house people who didn’t have proof of settled status. He was left sleeping on the streets, with
            untreated stage 2 cancer. To make it even worse, we learn that Sylvester’s mother had come to the UK in
            1960, to work as a nurse. She had worked tirelessly in the NHS for decades and had passed away in 2006.
            Gentleman writes how Sylvester was glad she wasn’t around to witness him being rejected by the very service
            that she had dedicated her life to. As an aside, I’ve had to fact check this paragraph against the book
            multiple times, as every time I read over it I’m left thinking that I must have made a mistake or
            exaggerated the story somehow. Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened and I’m aware that it may be
            naïve and privileged for me to be so shocked by the treatment of this man. This is just one of many personal
            accounts in the book that I have chosen to highlight, but all of them are equally heart wrenching, from
            Paulette Wilson and Anthony Bryan, who were wrongly detained in immigration centres, to Vernon Vanriel, a
            former professional British boxer who was stranded and homeless in Jamaica for 13 years. <br><br>



            There was a strong sense of betrayal amongst the Windrush generation that Gentleman spoke to, given the
            Caribbean’s complex history with Britain. Despite an extensive history of slavery and colonisation,
            twenty-five thousand Caribbean soldiers served alongside Britain in the First and Second World War. After
            the war, there was a huge labour shortage and Britain was desperate for workers to come from overseas to
            help. Campaigns were set up to entice people from the Caribbean, with a promise of a welcoming and luxurious
            life in the ‘mother country’. Optimistic, skilled workers uprooted their lives to come to the UK, to help
            run our NHS, to work on our transport system, as teachers, in factories and in the construction industry. On
            their arrival to the UK, it was made very clear that they were not actually welcome at all. Racism was rife,
            public opinion was suspicious and the government did not provide the resources that they had promised.
            Overcoming obstacles and battling racism all of their lives, it’s not difficult to see how the Windrush
            scandal would come as an absolute kick in the teeth. Some of the people Gentleman spoke to were utterly
            shocked that the government could do this to them, whereas others were used to such poor treatment from the
            British state that the scandal did not really come as a surprise to them. The long and short of it is that
            when we needed the Windrush generation, they were ‘one of us’, but as soon as it didn’t suit us anymore,
            they were criminalised and threatened with deportation. <br><br>



            Once the true extent of the scandal came to light, the public were completely outraged. The widespread
            publicity created so much noise that the government had no choice but to respond and try to make amends.
            Their response felt more like an attempt to protect their public image, rather than because they were
            genuinely sorry for what had happened. What came next were half-hearted and quite frankly, insulting
            apologies. Rather than apologising for the bad decisions they made, they said that it had all been a silly
            mistake - they hadn’t intended to cause any harm. What does it matter what the intent was, when the harm and
            impact caused has been so catastrophic? To minimise the publicity around certain cases, the government acted
            quick to resolve the situations of those who had appeared in the press. People whose evidence of their
            residency had been ignored by the Home Office for years, were all of a sudden told that it was all sorted.
            Sylvester was magically given approval for the cancer treatment and housing he had been fighting for. It had
            really been that easy. Despite hardship funds being promised and a small number of apology letters issued
            from the Home Secretary, a large number of people are still suffering the devastating effects of the scandal
            to this day - struggling to recover from the financial debt that they were plunged into, not to mention the
            psychological harm caused. It’s not all doom and gloom, as Gentleman provides us with a more hopeful
            statistic related to the Windrush scandal. The number of people locked up in immigration detention centres
            fell by 41% between September 2017 and September 2018, which has widely been cited as coinciding with
            changes to the immigration system following the scandal. The book is an example of the power of journalism
            to enact change, that isn’t naïve to the empty promises, hypocrisy and meaningless apologies that followed.
            Gentleman ends the book feeling torn. On the one hand, there is the fact that at the time the book was
            written, over 6,000 people from the Windrush generation had been granted papers confirming that they are
            living legally in the UK. That is undeniably positive. But on the other hand, has anything really changed
            with regards to immigration and racism in this country? We only have to look at the treatment and media
            coverage of Syrian refugees at the moment to see that it hasn’t. <br><br>



            One of the many things I really appreciated about the book was its exploration of who we see as ‘deserving’
            immigrants and why. Gentleman acknowledges the fact that much of the public outcry around Windrush was
            because the majority of those involved were taxpaying, hardworking, law abiding citizens, which evoked
            feelings of sympathy and rightly so. However, she also invites us to question why our sympathies don’t
            extend to those who may have had different life circumstances, who may have criminal convictions for petty
            crimes or do not fit our idea of the ‘ideal immigrant’. It’s always something that hasn’t quite sat right
            with me, the way that view immigrants as commodities, determining their worth through how much money they
            might make for us. Gentleman gives an important message - what was wrong for the Windrush generation is
            wrong for all immigrants. More than the technical legalities of the Windrush specific situation, there is a
            wider, ethical discussion needed about how we treat fellow human beings in this country, which unfortunately
            seems a very long way off. <br><br>
