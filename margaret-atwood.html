            On Tuesday, acclaimed author Margaret Atwood retweeted an opinion piece that caused a storm amongst her
            otherwise dedicated fans. The article, written by journalist Rosie DiManno, argues that using the term woman
            has become taboo, and that the use of gender-neutral language in its place is contributing to the erasure of
            womanhood. The article lacks evidence and critical thinking, promotes mass hysteria and includes lyrical
            puns such as “Man! I Feel Like a Person Who Menstruates” to poke fun at gender neutral language. The whole
            thing is giving me very it’s political correctness gone mad vibes. A quick google search of DiManno rather
            unsurprisingly reveals that she is not the nicest or most liberal of people. She has been accused of being
            hateful and racist in her workplace and 62 of her colleagues signed a letter stating that she is aggressive,
            degrading and a perpetrator of bullying and pervasive abuse. This just gives you a flavour of the kind of
            person that Atwood is concurring with here. <br><br>

            Back to the article in question, I think it’s important to make a nuanced distinction between when we might
            say woman and when we might use gender neutral language. The term woman is used frequently in daily life and
            mainstream culture, referring to those assigned female at birth and those who identify as female. The
            examples that DiManno reference in her article, however, are different. She opposes the use of
            gender-neutral language such as ‘individuals with a cervix’ or ‘people who can get pregnant’; terms often
            used in healthcare because they refer specifically to biology rather than gender. You may be a man with a
            cervix, so you need a cervical screening. If cervical screenings are targeted at women, you are excluded
            from this. You may also be a woman without a cervix, so targeting cervical screenings towards women is
            likely to invalidate your experience of your gender. This is why we need to think about making sure that the
            language we use in such scenarios is inclusive. In this way, gender neutral language is an important step
            towards supporting everyone and promoting better access for all. <br><br>

            I’m really struggling to see how creating more space for more people could be perceived as a threat to
            women, but unfortunately DiManno’s logic is a familiar trope. She appears to think that being inclusive of a
            marginalised group comes at the cost of a majority group. We have seen this many times before- in people’s
            fears that celebrating other cultures will eradicate Britishness, in those who staunchly believe that
            promoting Black Lives Matter is denouncing the rights of white people, and in those men who ask indignantly
            why there isn’t an International Men’s Day. We are so defensive as a society that we see anything different
            as a threat to us specifically, rather than opening our minds to the possibility of plurality. This line of
            defence chooses to completely disregard the dynamics of political and economic power, which is interesting
            to me given that Atwood centred her novel The Handmaid's Tale around the idea of power politics. <br><br>


            I feel beyond disappointed that Atwood has shared and promoted this view. The woman who wrote a novel all
            about oppression and control agrees that we shouldn’t use gender neutral terms to create a safer society. I
            am even more disappointed that, even after many trans and non-binary people have shared that the article is
            harmful to them, she continues to defend her position. I had always respected Atwood as a feminist, but I
            can’t get behind a feminist who doesn’t include the rights of trans and gender diverse people. After all, we
            all share the same common goals of equal rights and respect. Right-wing ideology and governments are on the
            rise across the globe and women everywhere are fighting for body autonomy and reproductive rights (Hello
            again Handmaid’s Tale). At the heart of this is patriarchy, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, racism and
            classism. In her collection of essays Women, Race and Class, Angela Davis argues that white, middle-class
            women have a tendency to defend their own interests in a bid to maintain their power in societies structure.
            I think this is partly what is at play here. Instead of coming together against the common cause, those who
            consider themselves as having power, or the illusion of power, may lean towards doing whatever it takes to
            maintain their position. Enter Atwood, DiManno, JK Rowling et al. <br><br>


            I am also surprised at Atwood agreeing with DiManno’s fixed ideas of language and words. The article calls
            people who use gender neutral terms “language radicals” and suggests that the evolution of language in this
            context is inappropriate. This argument of language being so immovable is not something I thought Atwood
            would get behind, given that she is a writer and a lover of words. I thought that she, more than most, would
            appreciate language’s ability to shift and evolve over time. DiManno also states that all this
            gender-neutral business is “tying everyone up in linguistic knots”. If a journalist and a writer can’t get
            their head around the linguistics of the word woman sometimes being replaced with the word person then I
            think we might really be in trouble. I’d like to also point out that DiManno uses the term “bitchy” in her
            article. It leaves me wondering whether a linguist obsessive such as herself is aware of the connotations
            that the word bitchy has for women, or does this not matter to her? <br><br>

            DiManno confidently asserts that gender neutral language will leave well-meaning people fearful that they
            will come across as transphobic if they don’t use the right terms, so just saying women is easier for
            everyone. It baffles me the lengths that people will go to in avoiding 1) listening to people from the trans
            community and 2) educating themselves. If you are that afraid that you are going to come across as
            transphobic, maybe you need to listen and learn some more. Given that language and attitudes are constantly
            changing, people are inevitably going to make mistakes and I think we can all say that we have used the
            wrong terminology at some point in our lives. However, the act of omitting trans and non-binary people from
            your language just in case you come across as transphobic is more transphobic and harmful than accidentally
            using the wrong term and having to correct yourself. Acknowledging your mistakes, apologising and being open
            to learn is powerful. Pretending it all doesn't exist is not. <br><br>


            Confusingly, in 2020 Atwood was one of 1,200 people who signed an open letter offering support to the trans
            and non-binary communities of the US and Canada. Unfortunately, I think people can get behind any cause
            until they perceive it to be a direct threat to them. Both DiManno and Atwood are now feeding into the moral
            panic that we can’t even say the word woman anymore. This is simply not true. We can say the word woman loud
            and proud, and at the same time we can also expand our language to make it inclusive. <br> <br>

            I will end with some quotes from The Handmaid’s Tale:

            <blockquote class="blockquote">
                 - Whatever is silenced will clamor to be heard. <br><br>

                 - We are the people who were not in the papers. We lived in blank white spaces at the edges of print.. We
                lived in the gaps between the stories. <br><br>
    
                 - I want to be held and told my name. I want to be valued, in ways that I am not. <br><br>
    
                 - I avoid looking down at my body.. I don’t want to look at something that determines me so completely. <br><br>
            </blockquote>
